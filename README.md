# Detection-of-Malaria-Parasite-in-blood-using-Image-Processing
This project positively identify malaria parasites present in thin blood smears.\
We take a digitalized malaria blood smear image as Input and Output is count of total RBC and
parasites infected cells.\
We are using MATLAB for processing the blood smear sample. The steps are as follows:\ 
1. Preprocessing\
2. Extraction\
3. Segmentation\
4. Morphology Operations\
5. Cell Counting
